# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! This Python-based game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. The game provides multiple modes and variations, including a custom range and an object-oriented approach using classes.

## Files in this Repository

- **GuessNumber.py**: Runs the guessing game with a fixed number range from 1 to 50.
- **User_range.py**: Runs the guessing game where the player can define their own number range.
- **class_GuessNumber.py**: Implements the game using a class-based structure for object-oriented programming.
- **logo_art.py**: Displays a logo with the title "Guess Number" when the game starts.
- **losing_scenario.jpg**: An image shown when the user loses the game, displaying a "Better luck next time!" message.
- **winning_scenario.jpg**: An image displayed when the user wins, showing a "Congratulations!" message.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the repository is stored.
3. Run any of the following Python files to start the game:
   - **`GuessNumber.py`**: Play the game with a fixed number range of 1 to 50.
   - **`User_range.py`**: Play the game with a custom range defined by the user.
   - **`class_GuessNumber.py`**: Try the game with an object-oriented approach using a class structure.

The game will prompt you to enter guesses, and it will provide feedback to help you find the correct number. You win if you guess correctly, and you lose if you run out of attempts.
